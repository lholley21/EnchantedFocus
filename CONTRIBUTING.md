  return `${minutes}:${seconds.toString().padStart(2, "0")}`;

  constructor() {
    this.workTimeMinutes = 25;

}
```

### CSS Magic Guidelines

```css
/* Use consistent spacing and organization */
.mystical-element {
  background: rgba(43, 26, 47, 0.8);
  border: 2px solid #76c7c0;
  border-radius: 12px;
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

/* Maintain the color scheme */
:root {
  --witchy-purple: #2b1a2f;
  --magical-mint: #76c7c0;
  --enchanted-text: #f8e7ff;
}
```

### Witchy Theme Guidelines

- **Colors**: Stick to the purple (#2b1a2f), mint (#76C7C0), and light text (#f8e7ff) palette
- **Font**: Use Mystery Quest for all UI text
- **Language**: Keep the magical/witchy terminology in UI and comments
